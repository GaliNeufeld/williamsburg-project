            <h2>Why Williamsburg?</h2>
            <h3>The picture-perfect neighborhood</h3>
            <p>
              Williamsburg is known for its beautiful view of the Manhattan
              skyline, trendy shops, collection of murals from artists all over
              the world, amazing bars, and fantastic food scene! This is the
              neighborhood if you love nightlife, food, and entertainment
              options – plus it’s just five to ten minutes commute to Manhattan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Williamsburg started as a prime spot for ferrying goods to
              Manhattan. Once the Williamsburg bridge was constructed, thousands
              of residents moved a cross the river from Manhattan and made
              Williamsburg their home. However, much of the area along
              Williamsburg's waterfront consisted of warehouses and factory
              buildings. In 2005 Williamsburg was rezoned allowing those
              warehouses and factories to be converted to residential units and
              businesses. That led to a building boom that transformed the
              neighborhood. Today Williamsburg has a hipster vibe as evidenced
              by indie music performances, gallery shows and shops run by local
              artisans. Distilleries and wineries show off the neighborhood’s
              flair for locally made spirits. Williamsburg is one of New York's
              most exciting neighborhoods with many of NYC’s trendiest
              restaurants and clubs.

                <p>
                  Bakeri is a cozy Scandinavian café packed with character and
                  charm. It has a French feel and the best part is, they bake
                  their own breads and pastries.

                <p>
                  The smell of freshly baked goods. The salads and the
                  sandwiches are all delicious and when it's warm out, you can
                  sit at their beautiful garden patio at the back.
