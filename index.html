            <h2>Why Williamsburg?</h2>
            <h3>The picture-perfect neighborhood</h3>
            <p>
              Williamsburg is known for its beautiful view of the Manhattan
              skyline, trendy shops, collection of murals from artists all over
              the world, amazing bars, and fantastic food scene! 
              This is the neighborhood if you love nightlife, food, and entertainment options – plus it’s just five
              to ten minutes commute to Manhattan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Williamsburg started as a prime spot for ferrying goods to
              Manhattan. Once the Williamsburg bridge was constructed, thousands
              of residents moved a cross the river from Manhattan and made
              Williamsburg their home. However, much of the area along
              Williamsburg's waterfront consisted of warehouses and factory
              buildings. In 2005 Williamsburg was rezoned allowing those
              warehouses and factories to be converted to residential units and
              businesses. That led to a building boom that transformed the
              neighborhood. Today Williamsburg has a hipster vibe as evidenced
              by indie music performances, gallery shows and shops run by local
              artisans. Distilleries and wineries show off the neighborhood’s
              flair for locally made spirits. Williamsburg is one of New York's most exciting 
              neighborhoods with many of NYC’s trendiest restaurants and
              clubs.
